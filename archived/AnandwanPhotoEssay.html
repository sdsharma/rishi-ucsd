<!--    <p> "THERE CAN NEVER BE AN URBAN SOLUTION TO A RURAL PROBLEM".</p>  -->

	<p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Since the chapter’s founding in 2009, UCSD Project RISHI has been working with a village in rural Maharashtra, called Anandwan, Hindi for “Forest of Joy”.  Last year, we completed a successful trip to India, where we piloted three components of our health education curriculum, including first aid, nutrition, and hygiene. Through our efforts, we hope to ultimately provide the children with the knowledge to practice behaviors that promote good health and disease prevention, as well as engage students in a social dialogue about health and responsible decision-making. The following images offer a look into Anandwan’s school and the education camps that Project RISHI is implementing.</p>
	<br/>
	<div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid s#FFFFFF' src="/images/Picture 1.jpg" /></div>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> A deaf student is being taught to associate words with sounds and objects.  The teachers of the blind and deaf schools in Anandwan continue to find ways to adapt their curriculum to the unique needs of each child. However,  they lack sophisticated resources and models to use in their lessons that keep the disabled children up to speed with their nondisabled counterparts.</p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Picture 2.jpg" "text-align:center;" /></div>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Anandwan is a village located in rural Maharashtra, which functions as a rehabilitation site for those that are blind, deaf, mute, and persons afflicted with leprosy. Along with providing basic education to the villagers, Anandwan provides treatment for patients and vocational training for disabled people, so they can support themselves independently and be valued members of society. Leprosy is 100% curable, but the problems that the patients face are socially entrenched. The afflicted are often forced to leave their villages in order to escape the prejudices associated with the disease.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Picture 3.jpg" align="center" /></div>
    <br>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Many of the students in the blind and deaf school share similar social injustices. With a society that is not accepting of their disability, students are placed in boarding schools by their parents so that their families don’t suffer the social consequences of having a disabled child. At Anandwan, this social stigma is left behind, and disabled children are taught to have a strong sense of community and accept one another. </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Picture 4.jpg" align="center" /></div>
	<br>
	<p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Two blind students are practicing the Heimlich maneuver they learned during the health education camp taught by UCSD Project RISHI members.  The schools in Anandwan don’t include health topics as part of their core curriculum, so students lack basic knowledge about general health practice. Our health education camps are designed to provide the children with practical information on topics including first aid, nutrition, and hygiene so they can make educated decisions regarding their own health. </p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Picture 5.jpg" align="center" /></div>
	<br>
	<p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> A student hazards a guess of how much milk should be in their diet during a nutrition camp. Interactive lessons take into account the students’ disabilities and allow them to engage the material and learn from each other. The villagers of Anandwan maintain a simple vegetarian diet consisting of lentils, vegetables, and ‘roti’; the only two commodities imported are salt and oil. Through the nutrition camps, the children learn how to create a balanced, healthy diet by associating common farm products with categories in a food pyramid.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Picture 6.jpg" align="center" /></div>
	<br>
	<p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> A curious student examines his health supply kit, which he earned as a reward for participating in a health education camp activity. The student must rely on touch to discern the contents of the kit and learn how to use them. Our goal is to supply professional tactile models that can be used throughout their health curriculum to introduce concepts such as anatomy and sexual health through a medium that the students find most comfortable.</p>
	<br>
	<br>
	<div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Picture 7.jpg" align="center" /></div>
	<br>
	<p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Project RISHI hopes to empower these children through education. A villager’s greatest asset is considered to be their own health. By teaching the youth preventative health care along with basic first aid, these children will be able to improve the quality of their own lives. </p>

    <div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Polio1.jpg" align="center" /></div>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> What's all this fuss about polio? </p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;">  On Monday the World Health Organization (WHO) declared the spread of polio an “international public health emergency.”1</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;">  Now, some of you must be scratching your heads. Huh? Didn’t we get rid of polio over 30 years ago? Sure, in the United States we haven’t had to deal with the disease since 1979 (coincidently the same time the U.S. last had a working embassy in Tehran), but around the world, cases of polio still plague some countries, and the situation has taken a turn for the worse. The cause for alarm comes from countries like Pakistan, Syria, and Cameroon from where polio has leaked over the borders to neighboring Afghanistan, Iraq, and Equatorial Guinea, respectively, making it an international problem. To exacerbate this, the spread comes during what is know as “low transmission season” which is from January through April.1</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> So what is polio? Poliomyelitis is a contagious disease caused by the poliovirus that can result in infantile paralysis and in very severe cases, death. Most people infected with this virus never even show symptoms, but for those who do there are both nonparalytic and paralytic forms. The paralytic type unfortunately affects the spinal cord or brainstem (or both) and this could lead to loss of muscle function, paralysis, etc. Health effects such as muscle and joint pain can be seen later on in life as well.2 Is there a way to prevent this? Sure is! Vaccines, administered both in the forms of shots and oral drops, are given to children worldwide to develop early immunity to the effects of this virus.</p>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Polio2.jpg" align="center" /></div>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Recently some surprising sources have exacerbated this spread of polio. As if it hadn’t bred enough ill will for the United States, the war on terror has had a profound negative impact on polio vaccinations. Drone strikes in mountainous Waziristan (a pretty troubled part of Pakistan) resulted in a 2012 Taliban ban on polio vaccination workers from going there, impacting around 240,000 Pakistani children.3</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Furthermore, the civil war in Syria has made things worse for both the Syrian people and their led to refugees fleeing to neighboring Iraq and taking the virus with them across the border, the first time in 14 years for it to show up in Iraq. Polio wasn’t a problem while our troops were there from 2003-2011, but now that the region is unstable, the public health systems there have been taxed to keep up with the vaccinations.4</p>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Polio3.jpg" align="center" /></div>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Some Good News, Finally.</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Despite the grim statement from the WHO, not all is bleak in the fight against polio. March 27, 2014 was a momentous day: the WHO officially certified India as “polio-free.”5 Having been born in India, the news that no new polio cases had been recorded in the past 3 years was particularly exciting for me because I’ve seen firsthand the impact polio has on the daily lives of people there. One of the key factors in India’s success was the aggressive targeting of underserved and marginalized communities, something that could benefit other countries attempting to fight polio as well6….And it seems that people in Pakistan took note of this. A great recent articles talks about the “Angels of Karachi,” fearless women who risk their lives to inoculate children against polio. Their colleague have been shot and and killed, but still these brave women rise to meet the health needs of hard-to-reach areas.7 Real talk, props to their goodness, an inspiration for us all.</p>
    <br>
    <div style="text-align:center;" id="photoessaytitle"><img style='border:2px solid #FFFFFF' src="/images/Polio4.jpg" align="center" /></div>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Polio can also do good for people medically. When I was looking up sources for this post, I found a really cool  news article from South Carolina. A genetically modified poliovirus by the Duke University Medical Center killed off brain tumor cells in a 23-year-old woman. Oncologists had already tried the works, and finally, when nothing seemed to be working, they asked if she wanted to try this new experimental treatment. With nothing to lose, she agreed, and the results were astounding. Months later MRIs show that other than some scar tissue there’s no evidence of the tumor.8 So see, glass half full, right?</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Vaccinate Your Kids, People.</p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Finally, last week (April 24-30) was the WHO’s World Immunization Week, and I wanted to use this occasion to highlight the importance of vaccinations in today’s world. The spread of polio is entirely preventable by vaccination, and the fact that new cases are popping up in around 10 countries shows that we need to redouble our efforts to fight this. </p>
    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> What’s also disturbing is that diseases like measles, mumps, and rubella (again all preventable by vaccination) are showing in cities all over industrialized countries like America because some people have suddenly decided that vaccines are bad. Succumbing to baseless assertions that vaccines cause autism (seriously? go see the evidence people) or have dangerous preservatives (thimerosal was recognized as safe, but phased out from vaccines to allay fears), a new movement of anti-vaxxers has arisen. People have taken exemptions to school-required vaccinations based on religious and personal beliefs, and honestly no one is doing their kids any benefit with this.9, 10</p>

    <p style="font-family: sans-serif, helvetica; margin-left: 10em; margin-right: 10em;"> Don’t believe me? Check out this supercool, interactive map from the Council of Foreign Relations: <a href="http://gphshot.blogspot.com/">click here.</a> As you can see the map shows outbreaks of preventable diseases in places of the world we’d consider pretty well vaccinated. Take-away from this: vaccinate your kids, convince weird people who don’t vaccinate their kids to do so, and donate money to increase polio vaccinations around the world. If there easily preventable diseases in the world, why not just prevent them?</p>
