	<br/>

	<p style="font-size:15px;text-align:center;">The main site we work at is a community rehabiliation village in rural Maharashtra, India named <a href="http://anandwan.in/">Anandwan</a>. This village was established for leprosy patients and other disabled members of society by decorated Indian social activist <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baba_Amte">Baba Amte</a>. Anandwan has approximately 4000 inhabitants and takes pride in its multiple sustainable housing projects. The only commodities imported into Anandwan are oil and salt. All the electrical appliances, food crops, and everyday items are made within the village, and they try to find a way to recycle and reuse any waste items. The single leprosy hospital in Anandwan has only one doctor who attends to all the leprosy pateints at any given time. Anandwan uniquely focuses on rehabilatation in the form of vocational training so that people can learn a new craft that they can successfully do in spite of their disability. Their goal is to empower its inhabitants so they can be productive members of society. We also visit Somnath and Mulgavan, some satellite sites in the area.</p>

<!--Health Education Camps-->

        <img src="/images/healtheducationcamps.jpg" />

	<br/>

	<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>General Health</strong></p>

        <img src="/images/generalhealth.jpg" style="float:right; padding:5px" />	

	<!--<p>In these villages, the general health information provided to children is uneven and in a format that is not age-appropriate. We attempt to address this by creating health education camps with  age-specific activities and topics such as hygiene, first aid, and nutrition that help both regular and disabled children of a specific age group better understand and apply the information they are taught. These camps are presented in an hour-long seminar format, and at the end the kids are given health kits as a token of the seminar.</p>-->
	<p> There is a lack of healthcare in many rural parts of India, including Anandwan. Our goal with the Health Camp is to provide disabled children with the basic health care that they lack and hope to make this a procedure every year. By bringing two doctors with us to the trip, we should have solid guidance and training in aiding these doctors. UCSD students will have the unique opportunity of participating in hands-on, clinical practice.</p>
	<br/>
	<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Resource Center</strong></p>
	<p> We are working toward creating a resource center for children that would help sustain any educational lessons taught during our trip. The students of Anandwan will have the opportunity to expand their horizons by having access to technology, educational material, art, and other resources. </p>
	<!--<p style="font-size:20px;"><strong>Sexual Health</strong></p>-->

	<!--<p>Many of the children at Anandwan, who are usually disabled, often fall victim to sexual abuse. This problem stems from the lack of sexual education within Anandwan - many of the children do not realize they are being abused until it is too late to escape the situation. The blind and deaf schools lack the proper models and know-how to effectively teach the children the difference between a good or bad touch. This distinction would allow a child to recognize sexual advances and either get help or stop  the situation before it escalates. These health education camps will give the children a safe, stigma-free space where they can learn about issues that they will face outside of Anandwan. By using methods that are tailored to specific disabilities, our group will try to empower the children with the knowledge necessary to lead safe, stable lives in society.</p>-->

<!--Swaranandwan Orchestra-->	 

        <img src="/images/swaranandwan.jpg" />

	<br/>

        <img src="/images/dancers.jpg" style="float:right; padding:5px" />

	<p>Swaranandwan, Dr. Vikas Amte's brainchild, is the music and dance troupe of Anandwan made up of both disabled residents and previous leprosy patients. It works towards increasing the physical, mental, and emotional health of both its performers and its audience through the concept of therapeutic theater. We aim to create an online media channel for them, help subsidize travel and equipment costs for the orchestra to perform internationally, and set them up with a sister orchestra in the United States. In the summer of 2012, UCSD's Project RISHI donated $7000 to their cause.</p>

<!--Blind & Deaf Awareness Campaign-->

        <img src="/images/awareness.jpg" />

	<br/>

	<p>In order to decrease the rampant stigma and intolerance in India surrounding physical ailments, especially within family members Project RISHI wants to work with the village school to set up higher awareness for disabled children. Many disabled children in India are not accepted by their families. Their parents transfer them from one special education school to another in order to shirk responsibility and avoid raising a disabled child. They severely underestimate the capabilities of their children simply because society has demonized these conditions. It is heartbreaking to see how children are ostracized because of a disability out of their control. The goal is to encourage parent-teacher conferences to foster parental involvement and to develop a multimedia scrapbook of artwork and writing from the blind and deaf school in Anandwan.  Through an organized and creatively composed presentation of the progress their children make while at Anandwan, we hope to expose the families to the gifts their children have to offer. As a follow up measure we also hope to send this collection to organizations throughout India to garner national attention.</p>

<!--Water Collection and Sanitation-->

        <img src="/images/water.jpg" />

	<br/>

        <img src="/images/tiredam.jpg" style="float:right; padding:5px" />

	<!--<p>The Indian government provides a stipend to families that lose their primary provider, so many farmers commit suicide when they have a bad farming year in the hopes that their families will have some form of continued income. Access to water for irrigation and bad farming practices plague the area. We plan to help the villages develop a sustainable water collection and filtration system that will best fit their needs. This project is in its developmental stages.</p>-->

	<p>The shortage and cleanliness of water has always been a problem in rural parts of the world, especially in India. In Anandwan, there has been a lack of water supply for 400 children. Thus, children only had the option to drink water from the river that contained hot and dirty water. After our team recognized these issues in 2014, we implemented a water purification system. The system cools the water and stores it in a water tank, providing clean water inside the schools for several hundred blind and deaf children.</p>
